            <p>“All out! All out! This is the terminus for the Alchyria-Anyef station! Kindly retrieve your belongings!” The conductor shouted over the PA as I gathered the few supplies I managed to salvage.</p>

            <p>Rushing out of the train, I made my way down the platform, hundreds -- no, thousands -- of people swarmed around me, each one in a rush. Were they late to work, or perhaps just a birthday? Who knows? All I knew was that Alishia was waiting for me, and I couldn't afford to be late. Not then, not there.</p>
          
            <p>As I was making my way down towards the exit, the blinding golden rays of the sunset caught my eye, it felt as if time had reversed -- as if I was twelve again, staring up at the clear blue sky, watching the uniquely shaped clouds... What was I thinking? There was no time to daydream. I stopped an old man and asked him, “Excuse me, where can I find the city center?” The town had changed so much since I last saw it.</p>
          
            <p>He hesitated for a moment, then replied: “Take a right and keep going until you reach Kyshia Street, then follow the left.” As I walked towards the center, my heart pounded. What was she going to be like? Would she still recognize me? This letter she sent me just a few days prior was all I had; A fragile lifeline. At least I'd have a place to sleep -- or so I thought.</p>
          
            <p>As I made my way inside the city center, I looked around to find a red building, about 4-5 floors in height. It didn't take long, it clearly stood out amongst the towering white apartment blocks. As I went up to the door to ring her doorbell, it swung open and out walked a lady with long brown hair and a green summer dress.</p>
          
            <p>“Oh.. hi! Sorry about that,” she apologized, “Are you new here?”</p>
          
            <p>“It's nothing, really. And yes, I'm just here to meet an old friend of mine, my name's Ancion, by the way.” I replied.</p>
          
            <p>“Pleased to meet you, Ancion. My name is Ahjeka, I have to get moving though, sorry. My husband is waiting at the train station.” she said, introducing herself.</p>
          
            <p>“Nice to meet you.” I paused for a moment. “Actually, before you go, may I ask, do you happen to know if Alishia is home?” I replied.</p>
          
            <p>Her face saddened and her tone lowered, “Alishia... Alishia has been dead for nearly ten years now.” My heart sank. My mind now racing; How? How could she have been dead? She had just written to me! I had her letter, written by her very own hand, with her name on it.</p>
          
            <p>“No, that can't be right,” I stammered, my knees trembling, cold sweat prickling my skin. “She wrote to me not more than a week ago!”</p>
          
            <p>Her eyes widened in disbelief, “What?! Impossible!” Her voice cracked, her eyes glistening with tears, soon to spill. Her next words, like brittle glass, trembled. “I- I remember the moment I last saw her: Her body... lying flat... on the ground-” she broke off, sobbing, “Her... skin, pale, like a delicate pearl. And that knife- a hole, carved right into her back. Her dress, her dress it- was soaked in blood- from head.. to toe, Oh... oh my poor, bright angel, you had not more than twelve years when some heartless monster saw you, and...”</p>
          
            <p>She shook her head, her voice trembling. “I... I can't-- I have no time for this. I must go.” Tears welled in her eyes, and before I could process the horror just described, she turned on her heel and disappeared into the crowd. And as quickly as she introduced herself, she left. My heart racing, I tried to follow her -- but it was no use. I was anchored into the ground, as if the weight of the truth had sunk my feet deep into the concrete. I stood there, frozen, as I watched her green silhouette fade in a flood of distant faces. I wanted to shout for her, demand more answers, I couldn't. My throat had closed. The voice of the crowd swirled around me, like a raging storm -- people brushing past in every direction, laughing, shouting, oblivious. As if my world hadn't just shattered into pieces innumerable. I felt as though I stood in the eye of a hurricane while the world spun oh so violently around me. As if to stand under a sea of sorrow, gasping for air yet drowning. How could this be happening? How could any of this be real?</p>

              Gathering back what little was left of my mind, forcing my feet to walk, I made my way into the building up one, two, three flights of stairs. I couldn't believe what she had told me. I had to see it for myself. As I got to the floor, my heart racing as the names on the doors moved past me: The Hericos, The Pylentoi, The Yshou... finally, the Arliten, her house, her door. I knock, three times. Nothing. I knock again. Nothing still. I keep knocking out of desperation -- tears lining my face -- until a man, from a nearby apartment comes out of his door.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              “What is all of this noise?! Who are you?” I scrambled to clear my voice and wipe the tears off of my face. “My name is Ancion. I have come to visit Alishia, Alishia Arliten, do you know where she is?” I said with a trembling voice. His anger calmed, “Alishia is dead. She has been for what... ten... years now? I honestly don't remember, they made a pretty big deal out of it, the police I mean.”
          </p>
          
          <p>
              I... no... no, NO, she can't be dead, she can't be, “She wrote me a letter... she wrote me a letter just days ago, here, I have it, read it.” I quickly took off my bag and searched inside it for the letter, I grabbed it and handed it to him. Skeptical he took the letter and began reading it aloud.
          </p>
          
          <div class="letter">
              <p>Dear Ancion,</p>
              <p>It has been a long time since we last talked, and I would like to break that silence. Why don't you come down to Anyef for some tea?</p>
              <p>I live in a five-floor red building in the city center. The code is 194-EF0.</p>
              <p>I can't wait to see you again. There is so much I want to share with you!</p>
              <p>Your childhood friend,<br>Alishia Arliten</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
              As he finished reading, he turned the envelope over, which read: <em>"To my dear friend, Ancion. Address: Alchyria, home unknown."</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>
              “You two seemed pretty close. Though riddle me this, how'd they find you? I mean, there is no address written here and the capital is a pretty large town.” He questioned, and to this, I had no reply. How DID they find me? “I... I don't know, I woke up one morning with a letter under my door. I don't know how it got there-” He cut me off. “Enough. I will call Mr. Arliten, don't you dare leave my sight until he's here, understood? Now sit down on this chair.”
          </p>
          
          <p>
              “Un- Understood.” I said in a panicked voice as he handed me an old wooden chair.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              Minutes pass. What time is it? I don't know, I lost my watch so long ago, I should've really bought a new one. Then, after what felt like eternity, I heard footsteps coming from the stairwell... “Mr. Arliten.” said the man, “Mr. Hericos.” replied the Arliten, “I know you, I met you when I was leaving, what do you want from us?!” she bolted.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              “He claims to have a letter handwritten from your daughter Alishia.” The Hericos spoke for me. “Read, Alyksys, is this her signature?” He added. Mr. Hericos took the note in his hands and read each word as carefully as his shaking hands permitted, “This.. is not her writing,” he exclaimed.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              What? No.. no I know it was hers, I know it, it must have been! It.. it had to be... Unless.. unless it wasn't? Unless that letter.. unless I- no, no I was sure it was hers. However, as if to prove me wrong, slowly, he began to pull out of his pocket, an old and wrinkled up yellow note, which he then narrated with a soft stutter in his voice:
          </p>
          
          <div class="letter alishia-writing">
              <p>My lovely papa,</p>
              <p>I love you more than anyone else in this world, you are the bestest-est dad EVER!! On the back of this note I made a little drawing of us!!</p>
              <p>Love you,<br>Alishia</p>
              <p>(PS: Do you want to come to my tea party?)<br>(PPS: You have to bring your own chair)</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
              I could barely see the drawing on the back of the card, but I could clearly make out what it was: A family of three with a two-story house under a barely-colored rainbow. I could feel the distress in his eyes as he turned to Mr. Hericos and said “This, this is her handwriting. This is the last note she left before...” There was no need for him to finish, his neighbor understood what he meant.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              He took the notes from Alyksys' hands, looked at them for who knows how long. He then turned them to me, holding them tightly in his hands. “You really ought to think before lying to bereaved parents like this, vermin.” He spoke, each word sharper than a knife nearly cut through my soul. Did I really just lie to them? Did someone set me up? If not Alishia, who is it that wrote this letter? “Leave, don't come back,” he continued, voice like a hammer to stone. “If I ever see you again near these parts, it may as well be the last.”

          <div class="container-text">
            <p>“You heard him, get up and walk in front of me. You are not welcome here anymore,” said Mr. Hericos with a tone so sharp it left a cut. As I rushed to my feet, afraid of what would happen had I stayed longer, the Arlitens moved aside, visibly shaking from the interaction.</p>

            <p>He escorted me out of the building, step after step, shame filling my chest. I lied to them, to myself. I left that place, my "home," hoping to escape the torture they convinced me was life... and, now? What now? I couldn't think of anything. All I could see were those colorful buildings... and that lively chatter, all so delicately blended into a mix of gray noise, colorless and silent. People hurried home, shadows growing long as cold wind took over the once warm streets. In that moment, realization hit: I had no place to rest.</p>
        
            <p>Resorting to spending the last pennies I had for a bed and some food, my stomach—hollow as my soul—twisting in hunger and recoiling in thirst, was a harsh reminder of just how much I had lost. After barely affording a scrap of bread and scavenging for water, I found my mind circling back to those two questions: Who... and why?</p>
        
            <p>I managed to find a hostel, thankfully not too busy, and was given a bed in a small room that had actually been empty prior to my arrival. I remember looking inside my backpack, scrambling to find another clue amidst the notes I had saved. I took out one of the notes she had sent me and a note I was saving to deliver in person; similar to a surprise gift. I put the notes next to each other, reading them over and over, each time my disbelief growing—the writing... it was identical.</p>
        
            <p>My hands shaking, the more I read, the more memories came flooding back. I began to remember that laughter, that joy, and that careless wonder that I had long since forgotten. I couldn't read any longer; putting the notes aside, I moved towards the window to catch a glimpse of fresh air. As I breathed in the cool summer wind, in the distance, a small building met my gaze, plastered over it were drawings of trees and sunshines, and a single light drew my attention to a single line "Preschool," drawn in crayons over the side of the building. It felt as though I remembered that building; it had been so long since I last set foot in town and yet, it felt familiar.</p>
        
            <p>My mind slowly turned back time and I could see swarms of kids running out of the doors, blinding sunlight shining over the sidewalk. I recalled an episode: it was me, Alishia, and a friend of ours. We ran towards a prairie, and I can still tell the feelings I felt on that day: it felt boundless and liberating. It felt as comforting as moonlight's kiss, and as soothing as those gentle winds, which animated the soft yet sharp blades of grass.</p>
        
            <p>Such a warm memory, I was beginning to get lost in that vision when all of a sudden I heard a knock on the door. It was a new roommate, great. We shared pleasantries and I made my way into the bathroom, getting ready for the night while he settled into the other mattress -- it was a hostel, after all. I wiped my face with warm water, making sure not to wet my hair or clothes. After closing the water and drying my hands, I looked up to the mirror. What met my gaze was no reflection of the world, no reflection of a broken man; rather, it was a child in what I could only describe as a black void. The boy stared back at me, skin as pale as snow, eyes brimming with fear, trembling as if a nightmare had just swallowed him whole. That child, I recognized. It was me.</p>
        
            <p>I was that boy in the mirror, I was that boy so vividly petrified, with eyes of remorse fixed on the floor. I shook my head—I could not believe what I was seeing, and when I glanced back, he was gone, I was gone. Standing before me now was a little girl, shrieking in pain. She was dressed in white and appeared to be no older than the boy, who just one moment ago stood in her place. As I tried to make sense of these visions, I blinked. And just as abrupt was their disappearance as when I first saw them. The reflection returned to normal, as if nothing had happened. The room once again reflected on the silver lining behind the glass.</p>
        
            <p>Turning to the door, puzzled and afraid for my sanity, I resorted to laying in my bed, reminiscing on what just happened. In that moment, I did not recognize her, even though she had an air of familiarity; her face just did not match with any I had known, or so I thought.</p>
        
            <p>A faint shimmer of light cut through the hostel's curtains, waking me from a restless sleep. I grabbed my bag and made my way to the cafeteria for breakfast. There I spotted an older man, whom I recognized. He had given me the directions back at the station. I went up to his table and asked to eat with him, a request which he obliged. He introduced himself as "Ortho," and after chatting for some time I asked, “Hey, uhm, mind if I ask you a question? I've heard about this girl—Alishia.. Arliten. We used to be friends, years ago. What happened? I heard she's dead?”</p>
        
            <p>He slowly turned to face me, expression mournful. Ortho's face softened. “Yes, she is dead,” he murmured, his eyes drifting downward. “It happened roughly ten years ago; she was found in a field with a knife in her back. Her death made the news; rarely do you see such things happen in a small town.” After pausing for a moment, he continued, “Sadly, her killer was never found, and thus she lives in the otherworld to this day.”</p>
        
            <p>The... otherworld? Surely... “Oh, I... see. Though, what do you mean with otherworld?” I inquired, wondering if this "otherworld" was a place, or merely a saying.</p>
        
            <p>“You know how each one of us has a soul, correct?” he stated, “Well, when one dies in this realm, their soul yet lives in a place we call the otherworld.” Wait... that means, Alishia, she's still alive, maybe... maybe I can still find her again. “Wait, does that mean that she can be brought back?” I eagerly asked, wondering if my friend could return, and if maybe I could see her once more.</p>
        
            <p>“Oh, no,” he laughed, “the only way that someone can be brought back is if another soul takes their place,” he explained. “And I feel like not many people would be willing to do that.” As he still laughed under his breath, he paused, then.. “Unless, unless the killer is found. Then they would be required to swap places. Such is the law.” Wait... so there was a way; that means that if I could find the monster who took her life... then, then she would be brought back! But before I could speak, “Sadly, few machines remain which can exchange a soul; *Soul-Exchangers*, they're called. I know the government wants to try and replicate them; I have little hope for that, though...” His eyes grew distant. “Ah, the ancients, such a shame for such knowledge to be lost; soul-tech truly was a product of its time.”</p>
        
            <p>...soul, tech? What? Wait.. what happened to the ancients? This made no sense. “The... ancients? Soul-tech? What are you talking about?” I asked in disbelief.</p>
        
            <p>“Ah, I see, well let me tell you a little story. Thousands of years ago, long before the great invasion, our ancients had mastered a very special type of technology, one which could toy with the souls of the dead.” He paused, then said, “They used this technology to revive their emperor; every time he died, a sacrifice would be made, and he would return to life as if nothing had happened.” He said, “The people worshipped their emperor as a god, none the wiser they offered sacrifices, unaware of their use.” He concluded.</p>
        
            <p>The thought of this crawled up my skin, people... used as nothing more than life vials... “That... is disgusting. What happened then? What was the great invasion? Why did we lose that tech?” I had so many questions, and I was about to have them answered.</p>
        
            <p>“Oh, young one, let's see. Around four thousand years ago, the great invasion took place; it was by the hand of our neighboring clan, Akhari, whose tech greatly outmatched ours. They ravaged our lands, taking anything of value. And when they came upon our technology... they burnt it to ashes. Anything which they deemed dangerous, anything with soul potential—they dismantled, burned, or locked away. Few manuscripts survived, even fewer the machines.”</p>
        
            <p>Having said this, he waved his goodbyes and left. Alone, again. It seemed as if more questions had surfaced than I could find an answer to.</p>
        
            <p>I decided to grab my bag and leave the hostel. I turned to the school, tracing the path of that vision I had the night before; I found myself in that very field. In it, I spotted a slightly weathered, small statue of an angel, with two pictures on its side. One of Alishia, the other depicted the knife. Between them was a note engraved in stone, which read: <em>"Please, find who held this knife, find who took my daughter from me."</em> I stopped, looking over the horizon at the far mountains and the vast plains, and as the calm morning breeze swarmed around me, my mind was taken back in time, back to... that day.</p>
        
            <p>I saw two kids running in a field. “Ali, ali, look what I have!” A young boy screamed. “What is it, anci?” replied a female voice. I moved in closer to get a glimpse of the kids, and I couldn't believe my eyes. It was... me, and Alishia, playing in a field. The memories rushed back to me. I remembered everything, and now I was watching it unfold for a second time. The running, that knife... the world slowed down, I could barely look as that knife sunk into her back... My dreaming abruptly ended; I now knew what had happened.</p>
        
            <p>I walked back to the city center. I recalled the buildings, the streets, and the monuments; everything felt familiar again, I felt familiar again. I rung the doorbell, knowing full well that soon... well, soon the parents would know who the monster behind the murder really is.</p>
        
            <p>I didn't need to wait long before I found myself face to face with Alyksys, and I could feel his anger. He closed the gap between the two of us. “You, again, I told you not to come near us again—” I cut his sentence short and said, “I know who killed your daughter.”</p>
        
            <p>Taken aback, his face turned from anger to shock. “Come with me.” He brought me into their apartment. I had seen it before; not much had changed since I had last been there. Alyksys briefly left, only to come back followed by Mr. Hericos. “So, let's hear it. Who killed her?” said Mr. Hericos, without wasting any further time.</p>
        
            <p>“Me, I killed Alishia. Ten years ago... we were playing in a field; I wanted to show her a knife. I tripped and... well, you probably know the rest.” Their faces fell in disbelief. The mother walked to another room, Alyksys barely holding his emotions. “You mean to say... that our daughter, our precious little angel, has been dead for over TEN YEARS, BECAUSE OF SOME LITTLE—” Mr. Hericos stopped Alyksys before things could get heated. “I will call the police, Alyksys, please leave the room.” Begrudgingly, Alyksys accepted his neighbor's request. The police arrived shortly after, I confirmed the story and was taken into custody.</p>
        
            <p>Oddly, there was no process, no hearing in front of a judge, nor a lawyer to speak to. Could it have been because I confessed everything? Likely, however, none of that mattered to me; I was the culprit, and I had to pay the price. My soul was to be exchanged with Alishia's in roughly three days; some scientists had gathered a grant to test out what seemed to be a working replica of a soul-exchanger. Time went by in that cell; I was fed no more than once a day with some bread accompanied by a glass of water.</p>
        
            <p>Finally, the day of the exchange arrived. I was placed into this green metal tubing, and enclosed with glass. The researchers were preparing for the process; I could still faintly hear some of them praying for this machine to work. After not long, I could feel it power up; pain began coursing through my veins. I could feel my soul being taken from my body. It was just a moment, a flash of light beamed in the room, and there I was, floating in the sky, without a body, just a lonely soul, traveling to the otherworld.</p>

          <div class="container-text">
            <p>With my body now dead, and my soul soon to arrive to my final residence, I can feel a sense of peace and tranquility, knowing that at last, Alishia is safe. I begin to see the green clouds of souls, all marching through hidden paths, towards an unknown destination. As I approach a large gate, fitted with whitered roses and an arch of silver metal, I am greeted by a much larger, blue soul.</p>

            <p>“I'niten-aq,” they exclaimed, feeling I did not understand, they repeated themselves, "What is your name?" This, I understood. “Ancion,” I told the figure, my voice half trembling. “Very well, follow them.” As he said this, a yellow soul appeared, without much hesitation they began moving, and I after them.</p>
        
            <p>They led me to a prison compound, with cages dangling from chains hung to no roof. In them, I saw an unnumerable amount of souls, each trapped in eternity. As we walked past legions of the damned, my guide stopped and pointed to an empty cage. Staircases made of ethereal light appeared beneath the cage, slowly leading up to an entry. I got on the staircase, step after step, the last one vanished once I got into my cell, and the entrance closed behind me.</p>
        
            <p>My guide, who up until now had been staring intently at me, vanished without a trace, and I was left alone in this cell, for who knows how long. Until the startled silence was broken by a shriek echoing through the otherworld, one you could feel in your bones. The distance, it didn't matter... that noise, that voice, I recognized. It was yours, it had to be yours, and now... it keeps lingering in my head, and I can't get rid of it.</p>
        
            <p>With the scream echoing in my mind, and my eternity to face in this cell, I guess there is no better time than to say,</p>
        
            <p><strong>I am sorry.</strong> If you ever read this, I am sorry, Alishia. I never meant to cause all of this suffering, I tried to help you, to free you from the errors of my ways, and I failed. I hurt you, again. This... was not my intention, none of this ever was. All I ever wanted was to show you that damned knife... and it led to this. From those moments of joy we shared to endless torture, how could I have been so careless? Had I just not run, maybe... maybe you would be free.</p>
        
            <p>I guess eternity is not waiting for me. The cell walls are slowly closing in on me, the last spiral of withered light left my eyes. In pitch-black darkness, surrounded by deafening silence, I felt unease, as if something was coming my way, as if death itself was nearing me. This is probably the last I write, a final testament to my failures, and to all the pain I have caused.</p>
        
            <p>Please, don't forgive me, Alishia. I don't deserve it. This... end, was brought upon us by me. My only wish is that, if I could turn back time, go back to that one sunny day, and maybe, just maybe be able to save you from this, I would. As for me, this was the only way my life could have ended.</p>
        
            <p>Farewell,<br>
            Ancion Bufyentash.</p>
